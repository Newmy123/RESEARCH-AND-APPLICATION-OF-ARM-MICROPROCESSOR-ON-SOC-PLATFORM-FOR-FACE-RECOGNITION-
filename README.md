# RESEARCH-AND-APPLICATION-OF-ARM-MICROPROCESSOR-ON-SOC-PLATFORM-FOR-FACE-RECOGNITION-
Use the OpenCV open library on the  embedded SoC platform for face recognition. Using the DE10 board, the method used for face  recognition is to use the haar Cascade algorithm to detect the face and then combine it with  the local binary pattern histogram (LBPH) to extract feature to train face recognition.
